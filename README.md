### <p align="center"> :warning: Update on my projects </p>

I've decided to freeze most of my projects to take time to focus on things one at a time for a better workflow, and to focus more on my health, so I apologize if I'm unable to meet your expectations with some stuff, I just really need the time to heal from my IBD.

### <p align="center"> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Extended description </p>

Hey all, I do programming for fun, and I hope some people can get as much enjoyment out of my projects as I had making them. A lot of them are still heavy work in progresses, so don't expect anything big any time soon, but trust me, I've got some big stuff coming.

##### For inquiries, you can reach me at my more business-oriented email: angelbot32@icloud.com
