### <p align="center"> :warning: Update on OpenParsec </p>

Unity's legal team sent me a Cease & Desist, and I've been forced to take it down. I'm going to reach out further and see if some compromise can be reached, but for now, all we can do is wait. It's been a fun ride though.

### <p align="center"> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Extended description </p>

Hey all, I do programming for fun, and I hope some people can get as much enjoyment out of my projects as I had making them. A lot of them are still heavy work in progresses, so don't expect anything big any time soon, but trust me, I've got some big stuff coming.

##### For inquiries, you can reach me at my more business-oriented email: angelbot32@icloud.com
